### Amazon DynamoDB
**Amazon DynamoDB** is a serverless, NoSQL database service that allows you to develop modern applications at any scale. As a serverless database, you only pay for what you use and DynamoDB scales to zero, has no cold starts, no version upgrades, no maintenance windows, no patching, and no downtime maintenance.
By using DynamoDB, your applications deliver with consistent high performance and nearly unlimited throughput and storage.

### Amazon API Gateway
**Amazon API Gateway** is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

### AWS Lambda
**AWS Lambda** is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources, making it the fastest way to turn an idea into a modern, production, serverless applications.

### Benefits of This Architecture:
- Scalability: Automatically scales with the number of users without the need for manual intervention.
- Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go model reduces costs, especially for unpredictable or low-volume workloads.
- Serverless: Fully serverless stack with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, which reduces the operational overhead of managing servers.
